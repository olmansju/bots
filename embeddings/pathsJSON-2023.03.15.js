Read the other slides before yours and make sure you do not duplicate what others have already talked about. Include your name on the slide. You may use the presentation notes section to add text and make links between readings and videos. Connect concepts to your future practice as a speech path or secondary teacher or special education teacher or connect to your present moment as a student or past moments as a student or SLP client.",
